“Echoes of the Sun” was inspired by the changing of the seasons, from Autumn into Winter. I’ve always found it a tough time of year with the memories of Summer fading and the nights drawing in, and I know so many others struggle at this time too. Learning to play the Kora has been the perfect antidote for me during this time, as it requires a balance of focus, relaxation and creativity which keeps my mind in check and brings a sense of deep inner peace.

This is actually the first song I have ever written and recorded, and hopefully the first of many!
