“Echoes of the Sun” was inspired by the changing of the seasons, from Autumn into Winter. It's a tough time for many, with the days getting shorter and the temperature dropping. Engaging in a creative activity can work wonders to maintain a healthy state of mind in this time. I've found playing the Kora is the perfect antidote to the natural feeling of melancholy - it requires a nice balance of focus and relaxation when practicing repetitive patterns or experimenting with some improvised ideas.

This is actually the first song I have ever written and recorded, and hopefully the first of many! I'd love to hear your thoughts if you want to leave a comment on YouTube, Facebook, or via the email link below.
